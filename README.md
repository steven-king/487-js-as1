Learning Javascript Assignment 1 starter files


Step 1. Step 1: Fork this Repo to your account with the Fork button on the top right.

Step 2. Git Clone this Repo on your local machine.

Step 3. Create a new branch using your first hyphen last name last name like "steven-King". Note: Typically, branches dont need the developer's name because a branch is associated to a git users but when this is helpful for my grading and making sure everyone in the class does not use the same branch name.
<code> git checkout -b first-last</code>

When you create a new branch using the code above, it automatically switches you to that branch. But if you needed to switch to a specific branch you can use  
<code>git checkout branch-name</code>

Step 4. Confirm your on the correct branch by doing a git status.
<code> git status</code>

Step 5. Open the files and do your assignment. I suggest commiting after each question. There are 4 questions.

Step 6. When finished, push your code to your repo using 
<code> git push origin branch-name</code>

Step 7. On your repo, do a pull request and merge it with the master branch on your repo

Step 9. Go to my repo: https://github.com/steven-king/487-js-as1 and submit a pull request for your branch.
